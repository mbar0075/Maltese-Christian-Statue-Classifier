abstract: >-
The "Maltese Christian Statue (MCS) Classifier" project explores the potential of artificial intelligence to recognize and differentiate between Maltese Christian statues, providing valuable assistance to those unfamiliar with Maltese culture or religion. Built on the curated "MCS Dataset," featuring 17 distinct categories of Maltese Christian statues, this project seeks to promote appreciation and understanding of Malta's rich religious heritage. Employing advanced image classification techniques, the project integrates AI into Maltese Christianity, a traditionally unexplored domain for such technology. With a solemn tone of respect and reverence, the MCS Classifier serves as a platform for cultural education, aiming to enhance awareness and foster deeper engagement with Maltaâ€™s sacred traditions, particularly during significant periods like Lent.
